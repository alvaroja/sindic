<h3>Introduction</h3>
Use the EDITOR class to create WYSIWYG-editable text fields. You can create as many fields
as you want. When put into a form, the contents can be submitted, e.g. to be stored into a
database. Look and size can be modified easily and separately for each text field. Besides
text-formatting, you can also insert images, bullet points, tables, and bar graphs. Other
languages are supported, too. Have a look at these examples:
<br/><br/>
<form name="f1" action="javascript:alert('FIELD 1:\n' + document.f1.richEdit0.value + '\n\nFIELD 2:\n' + document.f1.richEdit1.value)" method=post>
<script type="text/javascript"> <!--
var editor1 = new EDITOR();
editor1.create("This is a demonstration of the <b>richtext editor</b>.");

document.write('<br/>');

var editor2 = new EDITOR();
editor2.editorBGColor = "#B0D0F0";
editor2.editorBorder = "2px dashed blue";
editor2.textBGColor = "#FFF0F0";
editor2.textBorder = "2px dotted red";
editor2.textFont = "Comic Sans MS";
editor2.textFontSize = 14;
editor2.create("This is a demonstration of the <b>richtext editor</b>.");
//--> </script>
<br/>
<input type="submit" value="View Contents" onClick="rtoStore()">
</form>
<br/>
This script was tested with the following operating systems and browsers:
<br/><br/>
<b>Windows XP:</b> Internet Explorer 8, Opera 9, Firefox 3
<br/><br/>
If you use another browser or operating system, this script may not work for you - sorry.
<br/><br/>
Generally, richtext editing should work on Windows with Internet Explorer 4+ and with browsers
using the Mozilla 1.3+ engine, i.e. all browsers that support <i>designMode</i>.
<h3>Notes</h3>
The following browsers have been tested and do NOT support richtext editing: NN 7.0 and
Opera 7.0 on Windows, IE 5.2 and Safari 1.0 on Mac OS. However, the script works with them,
too - a simple textarea will replace the richtext editor.
<br/><br/>
If you use a DOCTYPE header in your HTML page, the look of the richtext editor might slightly
differ. The richtext editor looks best without DOCTYPE header.
<h3>Usage</h3>
First include the script into your HTML body (not head!), preferably directly after the
BODY tag:
<pre class="code">
&lt;script type="text/javascript" src="richedit.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
</pre>
Then create a new instance of the EDITOR class where you want the text field to appear. This
would usually be inside a form:
<pre class="code">
var editor = new EDITOR();
</pre>
You may wish to modify some settings:
<pre class="code">
editor.textHeight = 250;
editor.setFocus = true;
editor.fieldName = "htmlText";
...
</pre>
Finally, create the text field:
<pre class="code">
editor.create();
</pre>
If you want to create a text field with preloaded content, use this syntax instead:
<pre class="code">
editor.create(your_content);
</pre>
Please note that your content may not include any CR or NL characters, or else you will get a
JavaScript error. As already mentioned, you can create as many text fields as you want.
<br/><br/>
The contents of each text field can be accessed for instance with PHP after the form has been
submitted. The text fields are named <i>richEdit0</i>, <i>richEdit1</i>, <i>richEdit2</i>, etc.
You can change the field name <i>richEdit</i> either in the configuration section, or when
creating a new instance of the richtext editor (see examples above). If you want to submit the
contents of your text fields, you have to call the function <i>rtoStore()</i> first, for example
by using a submit button like this:
<pre class="code">
&lt;input type="submit" value="Submit" onClick="rtoStore()"&gt;
</pre>
Or use a form like this:
<pre class="code">
&lt;form action="..." onSubmit="rtoStore()"&gt;
</pre>
You should also have a look at the source code of this page and the included <b>example.php</b> 
file. ;-)
